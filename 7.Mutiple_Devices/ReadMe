Create 6 device files using commands : 
  mknod /dev/custom0 c 190 0 
  mknod /dev/custom1 c 190 1
  mknod /dev/custom2 c 190 2
  mknod /dev/custom3 c 190 3
  mknod /dev/custom4 c 190 4
  mknod /dev/custom5 c 190 5

In Driver - 5 Devices Valid
Last Device is for Testing (Invalid Device)

Open userApp.c and change the name of the file to custom0
Compile and Run
Check dmesg to see dev_id

Repeat the process by changing file name to custom1 to custom5

We will get valid dev_ids till custom4.
custom5 device will give error.

In this way inside driver we can identify the device and perfom device 
specific operations.
